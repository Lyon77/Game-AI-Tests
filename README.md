Welcome to my GameAI Testgrounds!

All the pygame movement and UI was NOT created by me, but the algorithms for generating networks and movement was created by me. Each folder has a corresponding README for what I achieved in each project

## Windows

1. Install Python (version 2.7.x recommended) [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. pip install numpy
3. pip install pygame

# Anaconda

We provide an Anacoda YAML file to provide a clean python environment in which to run the game engine. This Anacoda environment also helps with issues with MacOSX Mojave.

1. Download miniconda or anaconda for Mac
2. Save environment_gameai_yml.yaml to a directory of your choice
3. Run the following in the directory you saved the YAML file
```conda env create -f environment_gameai_yml.yaml```
4. Start the environment:
```source activate gameai```


Run the cooresponding runrandomnavigator# to run the code for that folder
